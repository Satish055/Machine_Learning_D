**LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL**:
It is Supervised Learning Algorithm
Linear regerssion is a Statistical Model to predict the relationship between independent and dependent variables 
In Machine Langauage : Independent Variable : Features & Dependent Variable : Target Variable 
The Simplest form of a Simple Linear regression equation with one dependent and one independent variable is represente by y=mx+c
**y=mx+c**
